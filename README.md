## 📌 Overview

**B2C – Bridge to Career** is a web-based platform that streamlines communication between the **Placement Cell and students** during campus placements.

Instead of relying on multiple WhatsApp groups—where messages are often missed—B2C provides a **structured, role-based system** to deliver accurate, timely, and branch-specific placement information.
